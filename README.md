Abstract 
======

This thesis presents a new methodology for visual scene analysis. This methodology consists of analyzing the kurtosis of responses of independent component filters. Here, our methodology is applied on three problems or subjects of visual scene analysis. The first subject is \emph{segmentation of depth-of-field images}. The second subject is \emph{segmentation of nature-made and man-made structures}. The third subject is \emph{measuring the perception of complexity in streetscapes}. For each subject, this thesis presents motivation, state of art, open problems, and finally our experiments and results. In this regard, our methodology exhibits competitive or higher performance than that of the state of art for all subjects. It is also important to highlight that our methodology is computationally simple and very fast. Therefore, our methodology is attractive for industry and consumer real-time vision applications. Notice that we also clearly present the shortcomings our methods for each studied application. This thesis also presents contributions to perception research. These contributions are discussed throughout the chapters, or separately in dedicated appendices.
